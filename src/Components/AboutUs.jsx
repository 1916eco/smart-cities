      <h1>Abstract</h1>
      <p>
        Smart homes have boosted productivity and have had a great impact on the everyday life of people that own smart
        technologies. Smart Cities Visualisation looks at this theory with a broader scope taking a whole city into the
        equation and finding out how having smart sensors and available data for the locals to freely view would impact{" "}
      </p>
      <h1>Aim</h1>
      <p>
        The project aims to bring all the data that is available from government-supplied APIs and globally available
        data such as the weather and air quality and visualising all the data together with a layering system for the
        users to be able to pick and choose what type of data they are interested in viewing.
      </p>
      <h1>Motivation</h1>
      <p>
        Smart home technologies have been of great interest to me as it is fascinating how much help it can bring to a
        family home with automated actions to switch lights on and off and routine actions such as curtains open at a
        specific time of the morning. All these technologies are done with smart sensors and taking the same ideas and
        looking at a bigger scope outside of a home and having all the sensors around a city could be as useful as in
        the house.
